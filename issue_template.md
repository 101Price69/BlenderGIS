<!--
Please respect the following template to report a new issue.

**Mac users warning :** currently the addon does not work anymore on Mac because of an issue relative to Blender Mac build itself. Please do not report the issue here. It should be fixed by the Blender team soon. Check [the bug report](https://developer.blender.org/T68243).

Before submitting, search through existing open or closed issues reports and through blender.stackexchange.com to check whether the issue already exists.

Make sure the issue concerns the BlenderGIS addon and not Blender itself.

In preference do not ask for help here, only report issues. If you need help on how to use the addon make sure to have read the wiki pages first. However, as there is no mailing list about the addon more general questions can be accepted here.

If you need help on how to use Blender itself refer to Blender documentation or requests blender.stackexchange.com, no support will be provided here on Blender general help topics.
